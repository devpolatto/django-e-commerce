# djangoecommerce
## python e-commerce project

### tools and packages:
**Django** => pip install django

**virtual env** => pip install virtualenv

    (Using virtual env server just to not confuse the installed packages, mainly because of the django library, but it's okay to install the packages in the global installation.)

**OBS:** Before starting the project make sure that the virtual env is active!

To activate the virtual environment just go to ```djangoecommerce/venv/Scripts``` and run ```activate```. Note that a (venv) appeared indicating that the virtual environment is active, now return the root folder "djangoecommerce" to start the project.
