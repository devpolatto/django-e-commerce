# djangoecommerce
## python e-commerce project

### tools and packages:
**Django** => pip install django

**virtual env** => pip install virtualenv

    (Using virtual env server just to not confuse the installed packages, mainly because of the django library, but it's okay to install the packages in the global installation.)
